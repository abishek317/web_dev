<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>An amazingly written movie about space and time. Emotional. Draws a beautiful connect between 2 concepts: Love and Time</p>
<h3>Shutter Island</h3>
<p>A riveting thriller about an officer investigating a suspicious asylum facility. Has one of the greatest plot twists I have experienced</p>
<h3>Memento</h3>
<p>A very confusing, yet amazing movie about a man searching for his wife's killer. Well written, with a very satisfying end</p>
